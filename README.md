# metric-converter

This is a metric / imperial unit converter I built. 

Once you type the number in and press convert, it will then output the values, converting between both units for length, volume and mass.

If you want to see it deployed, you can do so at: https://rishiconverter.netlify.app

Feel free to try it out and let me know any feedback. 

Enjoy!
